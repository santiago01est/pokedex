# 🔴 Pokédex App

A modern, high-performance **Progressive Web App (PWA)** built with **React**, **GraphQL**, and **Framer Motion**.  
This Pokédex offers a smooth, app-like experience to explore the world of Pokémon, featuring real-time data fetching, offline capabilities, and fluid animations.




## ✨ Key Features

- **🔍 Advanced Search & Filter**: Instantly search by name or number, and filter by Pokémon type using an intuitive horizontal scroll interface.
- **⚡ High Performance**: Utilizing **Lazy Loading** for images and Skeleton screens for a seamless user experience during data fetching.
- **📱 PWA & Offline Support**: Installable on mobile and desktop. Loads instantly and works offline (caching strategies implemented via `vite-plugin-pwa`).
- **🎨 Dynamic Theming**: The UI adapts its color palette based on the primary type of the viewed Pokémon.
- **❤️ Favorites System**: Persist your favorite Pokémon using Redux Toolkit & LocalStorage.
- **✨ Fluid Animations**: Powered by `framer-motion` for page transitions, list staggering, and "card deck" navigation effects.
- **📊 Detailed Stats**: View base stats, physical attributes, and move sets in a clean, card-based layout.
- **🌗 Sort Options**: Toggle sorting between Name (A-Z) and Pokedex Number (#ID).
